# VoiceRecognization-Project
## This Project uses publically available libraries for audio processing 

Voice is a medium that lets us communicate. We use our voice in the form of sound or written
material to put our thoughts so that others can read/hear them. Similarly, we read books written
by others to understand what they want to say.
It is hard to imagine not having this ability to speak, read or write . But there are many people
who, due to disability or paucity of time, have limited capacity to read or write.


### Technology: Python

I wanted to create a program to help people who are very busy or have a hard time reading
documents and typing documents. 

*1.* I want to give them the ability to speak their thoughts and the program should automatically transcribe what they say into a document.

*2.* I also want to give them the ability to use my program to read a documents aloud to them.

*3.* Give people the ability to convert their document from PDF to txt and vice versa.

*4.* Additionally, the program should be able to translate their document in a language that they
choose.

*5.* Finally, They should be able to choose all these services from a menu
